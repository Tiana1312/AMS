Project name: 
ABUAD Management System

Description:
This project is a simple AMS management API built with Express and Typescript which allow users to implement the CRUD operations. This project will use backend tools which will include Node.js, Express.js and Typescript. Users can register and access their tasks. Each task has a StaffId, name, department, and a jobDescription. The API allows users to perform full CRUD operations on tasks. This project was created to help me learn, practice and have a better experience working with TypeScript and building RESTful APIs.
