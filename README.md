Project name: 
ABUAD Management System

Description:
This project is a simple AMS management API built with Express and Typescript which allow users to create an end point to check the health status of the app and this will return days, hours and minutes. This project will use backend tools which will include Node.js, Express.js and Typescript. This project was created to help me learn, practice and have a better experience working with TypeScript and building RESTful APIs.
